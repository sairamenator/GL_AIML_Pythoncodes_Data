The area in this domain\\n\\twhich is inside a trimming loop had to be rendered. The trimming\\n\\tloop is a set of 2d Bezier curve segments.\\n\\tFor the sake of notation: the mesh is made up of cells.\\n\\n\\tMy problem is this :\\n\\tThe trimming area has to be split up into individual smaller\\n\\tcells bounded by the trimming curve segments. If a cell\\n\\tis wholly inside the area...then it is output as a whole ,\\n\\telse it is trivially rejected. \\n\\n\\tDoes any body know how thiss can be done, or is there any algo. \\n\\tsomewhere for doing this.\\n\\n\\tAny help would be appreciated.\\n\\n\\tThanks, \\n\\tAni.\\n-- \\nTo get irritated is human, to stay cool, divine.\\n\",\n"," \"From: djohnson@cs.ucsd.edu (Darin Johnson)\\nSubject: Re: harrassed at work, could use some prayers\\nOrganization: =CSE Dept., U.C.

If he/she\\ndoes not seem to take any action, keep going up higher and higher.\\nSexual harrassment does not need to be tolerated, and it can be an\\nenormous emotional support to discuss this with someone and know that\\nthey are trying to do something about it.  If you feel you can not\\ndiscuss this with your boss, perhaps your company has a personnel\\ndepartment that can work for you while preserving your privacy.  Most\\ncompanies will want to deal with this problem because constant anxiety\\ndoes seriously affect how effectively employees do their jobs.\\n\\nIt is unclear from your letter if you have done this or not.  It is\\nnot inconceivable that management remains ignorant of employee\\nproblems/strife even after eight years (it's a miracle if they do\\nnotice).  Perhaps your manager did not bring to the attention of\\nhigher ups?  If the company indeed does seem to want to ignore the\\nentire problem, there may be a state agency willing to fight with\\nyou.  (check with a lawyer, a women's resource center, etc to find out)\\n\\nYou may also want to discuss this with your paster, priest, husband,\\netc.  That is, someone you know will not be judgemental and that is\\nsupportive, comforting, etc.  This will bring a lot of healing.\\n\\n>So I returned at 11:25, only to find that ever single\\n>person had already left for lunch.  They left at 11:15 or so.  No one\\n>could be bothered to call me at the other building, even though my\\n>number was posted.\\n\\nThis happens to a lot of people.  Honest.  I believe it may seem\\nto be due to gross insensitivity because of the feelings you are\\ngoing through.  People in offices tend to be more insensitive while\\nworking than they normally are (maybe it's the hustle or stress or...)\\nI've had this happen to me a lot, often because they didn't realize\\nmy car was broken, etc.  Then they will come back and wonder why I\\ndidn't want to go (this would tend to make me stop being angry at\\nbeing ignored and make me laugh).  Once, we went off without our\\nboss, who was paying for the lunch :-)\\n\\n>For this\\n>reason I hope good Mr. Moderator allows me this latest indulgence.\\n\\nWell, if you can't turn to the computer for support, what would\\nwe do?  (signs of the computer age :-)\\n\\nIn closing, please don't let the hateful actions of a single person\\nharm you.  They are doing it because they are still the playground\\nbully and enjoy seeing the hurt they cause.
